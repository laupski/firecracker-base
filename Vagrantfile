  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
  # NOTE: This will enable public access to the opened port
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine and only allow access
  # via 127.0.0.1 to disable public access
  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080, host_ip: "127.0.0.1"

  # using a specific IP.
  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various

  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|

  #   vb.gui = true
  #
    # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
    vb.memory = "8192"
  end
  #
  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
  # information on available options.

  # Enable provisioning with a shell script. Additional provisioners such as
  # Ansible, Chef, Docker, Puppet and Salt are also available. Please see the
  # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
